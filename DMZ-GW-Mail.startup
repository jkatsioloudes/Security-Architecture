# The following constitutes a security restriction 
# where the gateway only knows about the WBS and 
# WMG LAN as business requirements suggest that
# only those internal components need to contact
# the DMZ and not the rest, i.e Internal Servers. 
# Otherwise the packet is sent to the external 
# firewall which is reasonable for those senders
# that contact the DMZ from outside.

# WBS LAN accessible through the Internal Firewall.

# WMG LAN accessible through the Internal Firewall.

# External Firewall as Default for the rest.
